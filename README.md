## I'm making:
A browser-based version of memory matcher.

## User stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to customize the game to use up to 10 rows by 10 columns with an even amount of cards so that I can play with less or more cards if I want to.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want to be able to customize the game to use any number of rows and columns as long as the number of cards are even so that I can fully customize how big the game will be and how many cards there will be.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want to see a warning when I choose to play with a large amount of cards so that I know if a game might take a while and take up more space.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want to be able to customize the game to match 2, 3, 4, or more cards so that I can further control the game and further enjoy playing how I want to play.
- As a user, I want to see the cards randomized so that I will always have a new game instead of repeating the same exact game.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose to have the game either reveal all the cards at the beginning or start with the cards' contents hidden so that I can make the game slightly easier or harder for me.
- As a user, I want to see the cards' contents revealed when I click on each card so I can see what's in the card I clicked on.
- As a user, I want the game to automatically flip the cards back over when I fail to match them so that I can try to match again.
- As a user, I want the game to end and reveal all of the cards if I fail to match cards 3 times (or more on bigger games) so that I can have a bit of challenge in the game.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want to be able to customize the amount of times I can fail so I can give myself a handicap if I want.
- As a user, I want the game to keep matched cards flipped over so I can see my progress in the game.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want to see a progress bar showing my progress so I can clearly see my progress in the game.
- As a user, I want the game to congratulate me if I manage to find all of the matches so that I know when I've completed the game and I can get the satisfaction of completing the game.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want the site to tell me how long I am taking/took so that I can have a challenge in being timed.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want the site to show my top times so I can compare my times.
- As a user, I want to be able to restart the game whether during or after a game so that I can try the game again.
    - BONUS: As a user, I want the game to warn me before restarting during an unfinished game so that I don't accidentally erase my progress.
